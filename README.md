# Task 1: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
Problem statement : Predict the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours.

Try: What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

# Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning
Problem statement: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

# Task 3: Decision Trees
Analysis on IRIS Dataset

# Chatbot using conversational NLP
This is the simplest chatbot built using python. It uses conversational Natural Language Processing. A leading python library Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is used.

# Covid19 Prediction Forecasting
Built a Covid19 Machine Learning Prediction and Forecasting with Time Series Analysis with available Covid19 Data Set.

# Speech (Speech Recognition)
This project is under progress.
This is a speech emotion recognition project. Currently the python file 'Speech' has male and female divisions. Trying to remove the gender classification. 

# Speech Recognition without gender classification
I have completed the following
1. Impoorting libraries
2. Converting audio files into tabular form for data analysis
3. Combining all dataframes into one .csv file for better data analysis
4. Data visualization (Audio files count v/s Emotions)
5. Plotting waveplots and spectogram for audio files
6. Extracting features - Under progress
